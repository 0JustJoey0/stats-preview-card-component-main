## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

What I learned from this project is how to utilize postion relative and absolute when trying to overlay 
a div on top of a black and white image to create a color hue. I also learned that I am terrible at organizing my code to be easly rearranged when moving from moblie to desktop and naming conventions when writing classes for css.


### Continued development

I am going to keep working on designing my css to be more translatable between different screen sizes as well as looking ways to improve my naming conventions to make my code easier to read. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This article has helped a lot when learning flexbox and I still use it today when I am uncertain when using the framework. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
